**Please Note: A prerequisite of this plugin is pro-reports**

 

Whats it do?
------------

Allows you to add work notes and clients notes based on date range to your
client reports on a site by site basis.

 

Usage Instructions:

1. Add extension to site

2. Then you get an additional menu item when looking at a child site

3. Which opens a new page:

4. You can then use the new [client.customwork.notes] token to show these in
your report and it would pull and display those based on the date range of the
report liek this

5. Which renders this in the final report

WARNING: This is a proof of concept and does need some additional work done;

Known issues to resolve

 

1.  Getting it to render as a sidepage rather than a new page

2.  Add a primary key to the notes to allow better editing to prevent duplicates

 

But for its primary function it may not be slick but it functions as designed.

 

Feel free to fix the above two issues :)
